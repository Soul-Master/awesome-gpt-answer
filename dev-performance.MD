# Do I understand correctly that total JS heap size after collect garbage in Memory tab in Chrome dev tools is absolute minimum memory consumption?

  Yes, your understanding is mostly correct, but with some nuances to consider:

### Total JS Heap Size After Garbage Collection in Chrome DevTools

- **What It Represents**: This value reflects the amount of memory currently being used by JavaScript objects, including variables, functions, and other data structures in your web application. 
- **Post-Garbage Collection**: When you perform a garbage collection (GC) in Chrome DevTools, it attempts to free up memory that is no longer in use (e.g., objects that are no longer referenced). 
- **Minimum Memory Consumption**: The total JS heap size after a GC can be considered as the near-minimum memory consumption by your JavaScript code at that point in time. However, it's important to note that this is specific to JavaScript heap memory and does not account for other types of memory usage within the browser.

### Comparing with Other Memory Metrics

1. **Windows Task Manager - Private Working Set**: 
   - This metric includes all the memory that the process has allocated for itself and is not shared with any other process. It encompasses more than just the JavaScript heap, including things like the process's own code, stack, and other system resources.

2. **Chrome Task Manager - Memory Footprint**:
   - This is a broader measure of a process's memory usage in Chrome. It includes JavaScript heap, but also other elements like DOM nodes, rendered graphics, and potentially shared memory. This value will almost always be higher than the JS heap size alone.

3. **Chrome Task Manager - JS Memory**:
   - This is a closer comparison to the JS heap size in the DevTools Memory tab, but it may also include additional memory related to JavaScript execution beyond just the objects on the heap.

### Key Points

- The JS heap size after a GC in the Memory tab is a good indicator of the minimum memory your JavaScript is using, but it's specific to the JavaScript heap.
- This value does not represent the total memory footprint of the web page or application as a whole. Other factors contribute to total memory usage, including browser overhead, graphics, and shared resources.
- Memory usage in web applications is dynamic. The "minimum" memory consumption can change as the user interacts with the application or as different parts of the application are executed.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while the total JS heap size after garbage collection is a good indicator of the minimum memory usage by the JavaScript part of your application, it does not account for all types of memory used by the application in the browser. For a complete picture of memory usage, you would need to consider the broader metrics provided by both Chrome's and Windows' task managers.
