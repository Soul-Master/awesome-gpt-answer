## What's different between nerd and geek?

```
While "nerd" and "geek" are often used interchangeably, they have slightly different connotations. Both terms originally had negative associations but have evolved over time to be more positive and even embraced by those who identify with them.

Nerd:
A nerd is typically someone who is deeply passionate and knowledgeable about a specific subject, often intellectual or academic in nature. Nerds tend to be introverted and focused on their studies or hobbies, and may not be as concerned with fitting into mainstream social norms. Common stereotypes of nerds include wearing glasses, enjoying math or science, and having an interest in comic books or role-playing games.

Geek:
A geek is similar to a nerd in that they also have a strong passion for a specific subject, but the term often implies a more pop-culture or technology-related focus. Geeks are more likely to be enthusiasts of video games, movies, comic books, or other forms of media and technology. The term "geek" has also become more of an umbrella term to describe anyone with a strong interest in a particular hobby or subculture, regardless of whether it is academic or not.

In short, both nerds and geeks are individuals who are passionate about their interests, but nerds tend to be more academically focused, while geeks are more associated with pop culture and technology. However, these definitions can be fluid, and people may identify with both terms or use them interchangeably.
